TATA Virtual Internship

Brief Overview:

This internship had a profound impact on me, especially in enhancing my skills as a data analyst. I gained access to valuable articles and learned how to choose the most appropriate data visualization techniques, enabling me to address various executive perspectives and answer their data-related inquiries effectively. This internship can be accessed on Forage.

Let me provide a summary of the four tasks I undertook during the program:

Task 1 — Framing the Business Scenario:

I developed the ability to anticipate the questions that business leaders, including the CEO and CMO, need answers to. By putting myself in their shoes, I crafted relevant questions based on the given datasets.

Task 2 — Choosing the Right Visuals:

I acquired knowledge on selecting the most suitable visuals for different business scenarios. Additionally, I tackled objective questions related to data visualization software, specifically Tableau.

Task 3 — Creating Effective Visuals:

Building upon the previous task, I applied my newfound knowledge by creating four visuals on different tabs. Using either Power BI or Tableau, I decided to use Tableau to answer the four given questions.

Question 1

The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.

From the Line chart plotted, the revenue generated for each month in 2011 reveals that February generated the least amount of revenue in that year. There was also a significant increase in revenue from September with the revenue peaking at $1.5M in November. This depicts that revenue is affected by seasonal trend and sales are mostly made in Autumn.

Question 2:

The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.

The Bar chart above shows the top 10 countries generating the highest revenues and quantity of items sold excluding United Kingdom. With Netherlands topping the list with $285,446 in revenue and 200,128 quantity of items sold.

Question 3:

The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.

The Column chart shows the top 10 customers generating the most revenue in a descending order. The customer with ID 14646 generates the most revenue of about $280,206.

Question 4:

The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities.

The World Map chart shows the list of all the countries excluding United Kingdom and their revenue. It depicts that the majority of sales occur in the European region compared to other regions with African and Middle-east region been the least.

Task 4 — Communicating Insights and Analysis:

I honed my skills in effectively communicating my findings, ensuring that I could explain the significance of each scenario. I created a presentation using Microsoft PowerPoint and recorded a screen capture, providing a detailed explanation of my insights.
